    "The SEI is a porous layer that forms on the surfaces of negative electrode particles from the products of electrochemical reactions which consume lithium and electrolyte solvents. In the first few cycles of use, a lithium-ion battery loses a large amount of capacity; this is generally attributed to lithium being consumed to produce SEI. However, after a few cycles, the rate of capacity loss slows at a rate often (but not always) reported to scale with the square root of time. SEI growth is therefore often considered to be limited in some way by a diffusion process."

    "In our simple SEI model, we consider a one-dimensional SEI which extends from the surface of a planar negative electrode at $x=0$ until $x=L$, where $L$ is the thickness of the SEI. Since the SEI is porous, there is some electrolyte within the region $x\\in[0, L]$ and therefore some concentration of solvent, $c$. Within the porous SEI, the solvent is transported via a diffusion process according to:\n",

    "\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot N, \\quad N = - D(c) \\nabla c \\tag{1}\\\\\n",

    "On the electrode-SEI surface ($x=0$) the solvent is consumed by the SEI growth reaction, $R$. We assume that diffusion of solvent in the bulk electrolyte ($x>L$) is fast so that on the SEI-electrolyte surface ($x=L$) the concentration of solvent is fixed at the value $c_{\\infty}$. Therefore, the boundary conditions are\n",

The thickness of the SEI grows at a rate proportional to the SEI growth reaction $R$, where the constant of proportionality is the partial molar volume of the reaction products, $\\hat{V}$.

However, if you plan on reusing your model and want greater flexibility then we recommend that you create a new class for your model. We have set out instructions on how to do this in the \"Adding a Model\" tutorial in the documentation. "
