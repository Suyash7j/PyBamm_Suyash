- If a solution contains cycles and steps, the cycle number and step number are now saved when `solution.save_data()` is called ([#2931](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2931))
- Experiments can now be given a `start_time` to define when each step should be triggered ([#2616](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/pull/2616))
